I have documented this Project for FUTUREINTERNS task Two.

This project implements a Machine Learning model designed to predict customer churn—identifying customers who are likely to discontinue a service.

Key Highlights:

Objective: Develop a classification model to calculate the probability of customer departure based on historical data.
Technologies: Utilized Python with libraries like Scikit-learn and XGBoost for classification modeling and Pandas for data processing.
Deliverable: The final deliverable is a predictive model, an insights dashboard (created using Matplotlib or Power BI), and business recommendations for churn reduction.
